*** Ruby 设计原则
    1. 简洁性（语法简洁）
    2. 扩展性（可以通过抽象，扩展类，dsl扩展语言本身）
    3. 稳定性（语法稳定）

**  Overview of program language history
*** DSL
    a language designed for specialized domain(s)
    - good API makes good DSL

*** Metaprogramming
    - narrow: use reflection to modify program itself 
              (enhancements in most cases)
    - broad: code generations

*** GC
    - methods:
      - reference counts (not good when deal with cycle reference)
      - mark swipe
      - mark compact
      - region copy

    - strategies:
      - generation GC
      - incremental GC
      - concurrent GC

*** Exceptions
    - should have good exception handle mechanism

*** Closure
    - methods or functions should be first-class object
    - methods or functions should have the ability to reference
      local varibles in some binding context out of itself
