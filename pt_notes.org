** Phases
*** Reconnaissance
    - gather info using active or passive means

*** Scanning
    - actively probe a target machine or network for vulnerabilities

*** Gaining Access
    - attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities to get into the system

*** Maintaining Access
    - install some backdoors in order to access the system when needs in
      the future

*** Clearing Tracks
    - delete logs of all the activities during the process

** Reconnaissance

*** Types
    - Active: directly interact with the target system to gain information.
      there's a risk of getting detected
    - Passive: not directly connected to the target system.

*** Steps
    - gather initial information
    - determine the network range
    - identify active machines
    - discover open ports and access points
    - fingerprint the operating system
    - uncover services on ports
    - map the network

*** Footprinting
    - gather possible information about target
      - domain name
      - ip addresses
      - namespaces
      - employee information
      - phone numbers
      - e-mails
      - job information
    - could be both active and passive
    - tools:
      - whois: find domain name information
      - find ip ranges and related organization information

*** Fingerprinting
    - determine what operating system is running on target
      - active
      - passive
    - tools:
      - nmap
